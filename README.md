<h2>SOC Automation Lab Part 2 </h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
- Install Applications 
<br />
- Install Virtual Machines
<br />

To begin, I'll need to launch a Windows 10 instance, which I'll set up on AWS. Once the cloud machine is up and running, I proceed to install Sysmon by downloading it from a Windows webpage and configuring it using a file obtained from GitHub.
