<h2>Generate and Capture Traffic</h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
- Establish access credentials on a public RADIUS server.
<br />

- Examine packet data and decrypt password.
<br />
- Conduct comprehensive analysis of authentication process.

<h3>Step 1: Create Username and Password on Public Server</h3>
